## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Example 1

```{r}
# a. z score 
mean <- 69
variance <- 9
sd <- sqrt(9)
zscore <- (63-mean)/sd

# b. 
z <- 0.6
x<-z*sd+mean

# c. p[x>72] = 1 - P[x<=72]
1-pnorm(q=72, mean=69, sd=3)

# d. p[x<x0] = 0.20 p[x<x0]
qnorm(p=0.80, mean=69, sd=3)
```

# Example 2

```{r}

pnorm(q=90, mean=80.5, sd=9.9)-pnorm(q=75, mean=80.5, sd=9.9)

#p[x>90]= 1-p[x<=90]
1-pnorm(q=90, mean=80.5, sd=9.9)

#p[x<65]=?
pnorm(q=65, mean=80.5, sd=9.9)

#p[x<q] = 0.72
qnorm(p=0.72, mean=80.5, sd=9.9)

qnorm(p=0.95, mean=80.5, sd=9.9)

```

# Example 3

```{r}

mean <- 2631
sd <- 500
size <- 100
sds <- sd/sqrt(100)

# probability that the sample mean rent is greater than 2700
# p[x>2700] = 1-p[x<=2700]
1-pnorm(2700, mean, sds)

#probability that the sample mean rent is bet 2500 and 2700
pnorm(2600, mean, sds)-pnorm(2500, mean, sds)

# c
qnorm(0.60, mean, sds)

#d
1-pnorm(2800, mean, sds)

#e
1-pnorm(2800, mean, 500)

```

# Example 4

```{r}
# a and b
mu<-0.73
sdphat <-sqrt((0.73*0.27)/150)
print(mu)
print(sdphat)

#c. 

1-pnorm(q=0.70, mu, sdphat)

#d
pnorm(q=0.80, mu, sdphat) - pnorm(q=0.76, mu, sdphat)

#e
pnorm(0.68, mu, sdphat)
```
